- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aves-Proxy.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lotta stuff. Gaming, writing, and art are my everlasting hobbies, but I've recently added programming to that list.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, and since the field's ever-changing it looks like I'll be constantly learning from here out! I've learned a fair bit of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and DOM manipulation in my free time. I'm continuing to learn more through SAIT's Web Developer program!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web developer projects out there!
- 📫 How to reach me: best bet is to message me on here, honestly.
